# Spaceship Titanic Data Analysis and Modeling

This repository contains Python code for data analysis and predictive modeling of the Spaceship Titanic dataset. The goal is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system and includes the following fields:

- PassengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger.
- HomePlanet: The planet the passenger departed from.
- CryoSleep: Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the voyage.
- Cabin: The cabin number where the passenger is staying.
- Destination: The planet the passenger will debark to.
- Age: The age of the passenger.
- VIP: Whether the passenger has paid for VIP service.
- RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck: Amount billed at various amenities.
- Name: The passenger's name.
- Transported: The target variable indicating if the passenger was transported to another dimension.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/Al-aameen/Titanic-spaceship/tree/main>
```

2. Install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download the dataset files `train.csv` and `test.csv` and place them in the same directory as the code files.

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the code. Make sure to update file paths as needed.

## Code Structure

- `Titanic_transported modeling.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis and preprocessing, model building and evaluation
- `Spaceship_submission.csv`: Sample submission file with predicted results.

## Model Performance

Several machine learning models have been tested, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost. Model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are evaluated and compared.

## Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and outlier removal. KNN imputation is used to fill missing values.

## Feature Selection

Feature selection techniques such as PCA and SelectFromModel are applied to choose the most relevant features for modeling.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project by improving the code or adding new features. Create a pull request to submit your changes.
